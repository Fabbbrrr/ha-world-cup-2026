```

6. Select **Integration**

---

# ⚙️ Configuration

1. Obtain a free API key from Football-Data.org
2. Open:

```text
Settings → Devices & Services
```

3. Click:

```text
Add Integration
```

# 🧪 Demo Mode

If you want to explore the integration and build dashboards before the tournament starts (or when no live matches are available), you can enable **Demo mode**:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → World Cup 2026 → Configure**
2. Toggle **Demo mode** on
3. Click **Submit** — the integration reloads automatically

Demo mode loads pre-built fixture data locally instead of calling the API. All sensors populate with realistic tournament data so you can design and test your dashboards immediately. Turn it off the same way when you want live data.

# ⚠️ State Size Optimisation

To avoid Home Assistant state size limitations, the fixtures sensor limits stored match attributes.

Tournament progress calculations use the official World Cup total of:

```text
104 Matches
```

ensuring accurate progress tracking throughout the tournament.

---

# 🔄 Data Source

Match data and standings are provided by:

Football-Data.org

Updates occur automatically throughout the tournament.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is an independent community integration.

It is not affiliated with FIFA, Football-Data.org, Home Assistant or HACS.
